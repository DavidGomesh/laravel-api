# 01: Creating the Project

To run **PHP**, I used **XAMPP** version 3.3.0, which includes **PHP** version 8 and **MySQL** version 8. I also used **Composer** version 2.5.8 to download the Laravel framework using the command:

```bash
compose global require laravel/installer
```

Then the project named **"laravel-api"** was created using the following command:

```
laravel new laravel-api
```

Then, a folder named after the project was created in the directory `C:\xampp\htdocs\laravel-api`.
